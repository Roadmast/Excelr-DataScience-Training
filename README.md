# Data Science Training Repository

## Introduction
This repository contains all the materials and assignments from my data science training at ExcelR. It is divided into two main sections: lecture files and assignments. The lecture files cover various topics and include Python notebooks, datasets, and other resources. The assignments folder contains practical tasks and projects completed throughout the training.

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized into the following folders:

### 1. Data Science Assignments
This folder contains all the assignments given during the training. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of data science, ranging from basic statistics to advanced machine learning techniques.

- **Association Rules**
- **Basic stats - 1**
- **Basic stats - 2**
- **Basics of python**
- **Clustering**
- **Decision Tree**
- **EDA1** (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- **EDA2** (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- **Hypothesis testing**
- **KNN** (K-Nearest Neighbors)
- **Logistic Regression**
- **MLR** (Multiple Linear Regression)
- **NLP & Naive Bayes** (Natural Language Processing)
- **Neural networks**
- **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis)
- **Random Forest**
- **Recommendation System**
- **SVM** (Support Vector Machine)
- **Timeseries**
- **XGBM & LGBM** (Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine & Light Gradient Boosting Machine)

### 2. Data Science Class Training
This folder includes lecture materials and resources provided during the training sessions.

- **Calculation Files**: Contains files related to various calculations performed during the training.
- **Data Sets**: Includes datasets used for hands-on practice and assignments.
- **Python Notebook Files**: Jupyter notebooks with code examples and exercises.
- **Tables & Other Files**: Additional resources, such as tables, charts, or other files provided during lectures.

## Installation
To use the files and notebooks in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Roadmast/Excelr-DataScience-Training.git
   ```
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine (preferably version 3.6 or above).

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (Make sure to create a `requirements.txt` file with all necessary dependencies if not already included.)

## Usage
- Navigate through the folders to access different materials.
- Use Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE to run and explore the Python notebook files.
- Refer to the assignments folder to review or redo any of the given tasks.

## Features
- Comprehensive set of data science assignments covering key topics.
- Lecture materials and resources to support learning and practical application.
- Organized structure for easy navigation and usage.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- (Include any specific libraries used, e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.)

## Contributors
- **S.V.Surya Narayana Reddy** - Completed the training and compiled this repository.


### Notes:
- If you have a `requirements.txt` file, make sure it lists all the necessary Python packages. If you don't have one, I can help you create it.
- If there are any specific details or customizations you'd like to add, feel free to let me know!
